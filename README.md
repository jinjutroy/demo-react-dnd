# Wellcome to with Demo React DnD 

### If you want run code with local network: 
 > run `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
 
### Link deploy production: https://demo-react-dnd.vercel.app 

### Some things about demo:
- The ecosystem has 2 sites (or pages): Admin to manage and Consumer to present.\
- API and data of your choices to show demonstrations (not important but should be
one of Java, Nuxtjs, Nextjs, Expressjs)
> Link API: https://api-demo-nextjs.herokuapp.com/api/data
##### Admin 
- Builder to Drag and Drop components (like WordPress). For now, we just need
to have Paragraph and Button.
- Admin can change paragraph's text and button's alert message (read more in
Consumer's requirement).
- Ability to undo and redo.
- Export and import the page to save and load later.
##### Consumer
- Display the pages that are built by the Admin site (View Mode). When the user
clicks the button, show an alert with the message set by Admin.

> I have applied the following technologies:
> 
> - ReactJS
> - NextJS (API) 
> - Lib: ReactDnD, Redux
